# USART driver asynchronous - USART multi instance

This example echoes the received characters over the two consoles using the USART driver in asynchronous mode.

## Description

This example uses the USART driver in asynchronous mode in both Bare-Metal and RTOS environments to communicate over two consoles. It receives and echoes back the characters entered by the user on the respective console.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core_apps_sam_9x60) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/driver/usart/async/usart_multi_instance/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_9x60_curiosity.X <br> sam_9x60_curiosity_freertos.X | [SAM9X60-Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A) |

### Setting up [SAM9X60-Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A)

#### Addtional hardware required

- Insert [USB UART CLICK](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) board into MIKROBUS Connector J8
- Connect the USB port J1 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board)
- Connect the JTAG J12 on board to the computer using a JTAG based debugger
- Connect the J11 on board to the computer using a UART-FTDI cable (to enable debug com port)

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer for both ports
2. Connect the COM port and configure the serial settings as follows (for both ports):
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and program the application using its IDE
4. Type a character and observe the output on the two consoles as shown below:
    - If success the character typed echoes back and an LED toggles on each time the character is echoed
    - **Console 1**

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAM9X60-Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A)  | RGB_LED(Green) |
