# USART driver synchronous - USART echo

This example echoes the received characters over the console using the USART driver in synchronous mode.

## Description

This example uses the USART driver in synchronous mode in RTOS environment to communicate over the console. It receives and echo's back the characters entered by the user.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core_apps_sam_9x60) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/driver/usart/sync/usart_echo/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| sam_9x60_curiosity_freertos.X | MPLABX project for [SAM9X60-Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A) |

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_9x60_curiosity_freertos.X | [SAM9X60-Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A) |

### Setting up [SAM9X60-Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A)

- Connect the USB port J1 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board)
- Connect the JTAG J12 on board to the computer using a JTAG based debugger
- Connect the J11 on board to the computer using a UART-FTDI cable (to enable debug com port)

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer.
2. Connect to the EDBG/Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and program the application using its IDE
4. Type a character and observe the output on the console as shown below:

    ![output_async_usart_echo](images/output_sync_usart_echo.png)

5. LED toggles each time the character is echoed

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAM9X60-Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A)  | RGB_LED(Green) |
