# USART driver synchronous - USART multi instance

This example echoes the received characters over the two consoles using the USART driver in synchronous mode.

## Description

This example uses the USART driver in synchronous mode RTOS environments to communicate over two consoles. It receives and echoes back the characters entered by the user on the respective console.

### Setting up [SAM9X60-EK Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/DT100126)

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system
- [USB UART CLICK](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) board

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/at91bootstrap/blob/sam9x60ek/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- Insert [USB UART CLICK](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) board into MIKROBUS Connector J14
- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC0 (J4)
- Connect the USB port J22 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to enable debug com port)
- Connect the USB port J7 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board)
- *NOTE - Reset push button is labelled as SW3*

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer for both ports
5. Connect to the EDBG/Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
6. Reset the board to run the application
7. Type ten characters and observe the output on the two consoles as shown below:
    - If success, when ten characters are typed it will be echoed back on the console and LED is toggled every time the characters are echoed
    - **Console 1**
