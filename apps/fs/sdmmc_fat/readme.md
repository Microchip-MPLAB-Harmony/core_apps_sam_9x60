# FAT filesystem using SDMMC Media

This application shows an example of using the MPLAB Harmony File System to access and modify the contents of a SD card using the SDMMC driver.

## Description

### File System Operations on the SD Card:

- Application opens a file named **FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG** in the root directory of the SD card and reads its content into memory
  - The image file could be any arbitrary JPEG (image) file chosen by the user and then renamed to **FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG**
- Application creates directory named **Dir1** in the root directory
- Application creates a new file named **FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG** inside **Dir1**
- Application copies the content from step 1 into this newly created file

The reason for choosing a JPEG file for test purposes is that the duplicate file, **Dir1/FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG** created by the demonstration could be easily verified for correctness.If the new file inside **Dir1** opens for viewing on the computer and matches to original image, the test is deemed to have passed. Otherwise, if the file does not open (i.e., is corrupted), the test will be considered to have failed.

### Note

*Since the application creates a directory named Dir1, it is important that the a folder with the same name does not exist on the SD card. If a directory named Dir1 is already present on the SD card, the application will fail.*

## Downloading and building the application

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_9x60_curiosity.X <br> sam_9x60_curiosity_freertos.X | [SAM9X60-Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A) |
|||

### Setting up [SAM9X60-Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A)

- Insert the SD card into SDMMC0 (J3) slot on the board (SD Card with FAT32 file system and **FILE_TOO_LONG_NAME_EXAMPLE_123.JPG** file)
- Connect the USB port J1 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board)
- Connect the JTAG J12 on board to the computer using a JTAG based debugger

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. The LED is turned ON if there was no error during creating the directory and copying the file into it

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAM9X60-Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A)  | RGB_LED(Green) |
