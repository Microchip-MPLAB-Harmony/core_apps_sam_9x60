    "content": "This demonstration creates four tasks each of differen priority. Task1 has the lowest priority, followed by Task2, Task3 and Task4 which has the highest priority. Task1 and Task2 run periodically. Task3 blocks until a character is received on UART terminal. Task3 registers a read callback with the DBGU PLIB and blcoks on a DBGU receive semaphore. The semaphore is given from the registered callback which is called when a character is receved on the terminal. Task4 blocks until a user switch is pressed. Task4 registers a callback for the switch press event with the PIO peripheral and then blocks on the switch press semaphore. The semaphore is given from the registered callback which is called when the switch is pressed. All the tasks print messages on the UART terminal to indicate tasks entry/exit. Since all the tasks use the same DBGU peripheral library, a mutex is used to guard the shared resource (DBGU ring buffer). | Task1: Task1 is configured for priority 1 (lowest of all the application tasks). The task1 runs for about 100 ticks and then blocks for 10 milliseconds. Each time task1 is run, it prints a message on the UART console “Tsk1-P1 &lt;-“ where, the &lt;- symbol indicates that task1 is running. Just before blocking it prints another message on the UART console “Tsk1-P1 -&gt;” where, the -&gt; symbol indicates that task1 is about to put itself into a blocked state. | Task2: Task2 is configured for priority 2. The task2 runs for about 10 ticks and then blocks for 250 milliseconds. Each time task2 is run, it prints a message on the UART console “Tsk2-P2 &lt;-“ where, the &lt;- symbol indicates that task2 is running. Just before blocking it prints another message on the UART console “Tsk2-P2 -&gt;” where, the -&gt; symbol indicates that task2 is about to put itself into a blocked state. | Task3: Task3 is configured for priority 3. It remains blocked on a semaphore which is released when a character is entered on the UART console. Once active, the task reads out the received characters and toggles LED if letter ‘L’ or ‘l’ is pressed. The task then runs for about 50 ticks, before again blocking itself until a new character is received. Each time task3 is run, it prints a message on the UART console “Tsk3-P3 &lt;-“ where, the &lt;- symbol indicates that task2 is running. Just before blocking it prints another message on the UART console “Tsk3-P3 -&gt;” where, the -&gt; symbol indicates that task3 is about to put itself into a blocked state. | Task4: Task4 is configured for priority 4 (highest of all the application tasks). It remains blocked on a semaphore which is released when a user switch is pressed. Once active, the task runs for about 10 ticks, before again blocking itself until the switch is pressed again. Each time task4 is run, it prints a message on the UART console “Tsk4-P4 &lt;-“ where, the &lt;- symbol indicates that task4 is running. Just before blocking it prints another message on the UART console “Tsk4-P4 -&gt;” where, the -&gt; symbol indicates that task4 is about to put itself into a blocked state. | .

This require all peripherals and clock leading to the DRAM memory to be configured prior to the application being programmed. This is done using a bootstrap loader. Bootstrap loader project used for this purpose is a variant of the AT91Bootstrap project available for Microchip MPUs. It can be downloaded from here. This project is adapted to be used from within MPLABx IDE on both Windows and Linux. To facilitate the debugging and running of the MPU application, each application in this repository is bundled with its own copy of the AT91Bootstrap project. Each copy of the bootstrap project can be found under same folder as the application project and is named and is prefixed with “at91bootstrap_”. For eg: if the application folder name is sam_9x60_ek.X, then bootstrap project folder will be named at91bootstrap_sam_9x60_ek.X and will be present at the same folder level. Bootstrap project is configured to load and execute a raw binary file named “harmony.bin” from the SD card. SD card slot to be used shall vary with the evaluation kit. Each application project is configured with a post build step which will generate the necessary binary file named “harmony.bin” at the end of each build. If you are only interested in running or debugging the MPU applications in this repository , you can skip the following sections and and jump straight to Debugging MPU application using MPLABx. Each copy of the bootstrap project in this repository is preconfigured to the correct evaluation kit.Also, the bootstrap binary files required to program and run the applications are checked into the repository.
